# Liver-Disease-Analysis
## Overview
This project involves the analysis of the Indian Liver Patient Dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains records of 416 patients diagnosed with liver disease and 167 patients without liver disease. The primary objective is to apply various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of liver disease based on different clinical features.

## Dataset Information
Name: Indian Liver Patient Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Description: The dataset comprises 583 patient records, including 416 patients diagnosed with liver disease (positive class) and 167 patients without liver disease (negative class). The information is captured in the class label named 'Selector.' There are 10 variables per patient:
Age
Gender
Total Bilirubin
Direct Bilirubin
Total Proteins
Albumin
A/G Ratio (Albumin and Globulin Ratio)
SGPT (Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase)
SGOT (Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase)
Alkphos (Alkaline Phosphotase)
Gender Distribution: Of the 583 patient records, 441 are male, and 142 are female.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Applied
Various machine learning algorithms were applied to predict the presence or absence of liver disease based on the dataset:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Naive Bayes


## Dependencies
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebooks
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
